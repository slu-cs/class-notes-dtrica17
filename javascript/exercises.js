// Some sample exercises in Javascript

// 1. Print the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 through 10
let sum = 0;
for (let x = 1; x <= 10; x++) {
  console.log(x * x);
  sum = sum + x * x;
}
console.log(sum);

// 2. Print the first Fibonacci number that is greater than 1000



// 3. Print the number of integers from 1 through 100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both
